   I  personally think a mobile is a must-have thing  and there are some reasons why. To begin with, it`s  necessary in emergencies : for example, to call the police or an ambulance.  Then, I don`t use it for silly chats. I just call my dearest  & nearest to congratulate them on  birthday. Moreover, I use my  mobile to tell my mum I`m OK or if I`m running late. Lastly, I-phones make it possible to surf the Internet or have an electronic dictionary to hand.                                              On the other hand, some people don`t see the real need to  have mobiles everywhere.  Firstly, they think it`s not good  when a mobile suddenly goes off and disturbs others. They also think  it can be a target for thieves. I can`t completely agree and believe that a  mobile is a perfect way to keep in touch
